    "passage_text": "The mating environment hypothesis predicts that populations of flowering plants compensate for reduced mating opportunities due to dichogamy (a plant's expression of male and female functions at separate times to prevent self-pollination) by adjusting the bias of floral sex allocation during the flowering period, increasing the probability of successful cross-plant pollination. Researchers tested the hypothesis by examining a population of broadleaf arrowhead, a plant for which bloom onset generally takes longer for male flowers than for female flowers, during the flowering season. They concluded that the mating environment hypothesis is not well supported by their observational data.",

      "A. Whereas the total number of open flowers per growth unit peaked on day 15, the proportion of male flowers experienced a peak earlier in the flowering season, on day 10.",
      "B. Despite the sharp reduction in the total number of open flowers per growth unit from day 15 to 20, there was no decline in the estimated reproductive success rate of male flowers in that interval.",
      "C. Sex allocations were largely evenly distributed on days 10 and 15 but were female biased on days 5 and 20.",
      "D. Although sex allocations became overwhelmingly female biased by day 20, male flowers\u2019 estimated reproductive success rate did not vary from day 5 to 20."

    "correct_answer": [
      "D"
    ],
    "explanation": "The researchers concluded that the mating environment hypothesis is not supported, meaning the data should show that adjusting sex allocation did not affect reproductive success. Option D correctly identifies that despite female bias in sex allocation (proportion of male flowers drops to 0.13 on day 20), the estimated reproductive success rate of male flowers remained constant at 0.29 throughout all days, indicating no compensation effect.",
