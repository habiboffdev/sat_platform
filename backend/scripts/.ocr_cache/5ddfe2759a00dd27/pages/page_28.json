Mark for Review**\n\nThe student wants to contrast dichloromethane and tetradecafluorohexane. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?\n- A) Dichloromethane, a hydrochlorocarbon, is composed of hydrogen, chlorine, and carbon; tetradecafluorohexane, a perfluorocarbon, is composed of fluorine and carbon.\n- B) Dichloromethane and tetradecafluorohexane are chemical compounds used in cooling technologies; the compounds are known as refrigerants.\n- C) The hydrochlorocarbon dichloromethane and the perfluorocarbon tetradecafluorohexane are both refrigerants that can be used in cooling technologies like air conditioners.\n- D) Tetradecafluorohexane, a refrigerant, can be used in cooling technologies to absorb heat and release cold air.",
