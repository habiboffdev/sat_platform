The equation of a line of best fit for the relationship in data set A can be written as $y = -5.1 + 8.7x$, where $2 \\leq x \\leq 6$.\n\nThe puppy was weighed again at 9 months old and weighed 52 pounds. Data set B consists of all the data points in data set A as well as the data point (9, 52). The equation of a line of best fit for data set B can be written as $y = r + sx$, where $r$ and $s$ are constants and $2 \\leq x \\leq 9$. Assuming the equations of the lines of best fit are calculated in the same way, which of the following is the best estimate for the value of $s$?\n\nA) 5.9  \nB) 8.7  \nC) 13.8  \nD) 17.7  \n\n---",
