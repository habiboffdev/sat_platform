Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?\n\nA. Vaalbara and Euramerica were both supercontinents, single landmasses made up of most or all of Earth\u2019s continents.  \nB. The supercontinent Euramerica formed long after the supercontinent Vaalbara.  \nC. Forming and breaking apart over hundreds of millions of years, supercontinents are made up of most or all of Earth\u2019s continents.  \nD. Vaalbara formed about 3.6 billion years ago but eventually broke apart.  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need anything else!",
