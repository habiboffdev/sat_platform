Here\u2019s the extracted text:\n\n---\n\n**Section 1, Module 2: Reading and Writing**\n\n**Directions**\n\nWhile researching a topic, a student has taken the following notes:\n\n- Kale is a vegetable that contains ascorbic acid, an essential nutrient for humans.\n- Apricots are fruits that contain ascorbic acid.\n- There is 120 milligrams (mg) of ascorbic acid per every 100 grams (g) of kale.\n- There is 10 mg of ascorbic acid per every 100 g of apricot.\n- Humans cannot make ascorbic acid in their bodies, so they must get it from foods, including fruits and vegetables.\n- Ascorbic acid is also known as vitamin C.\n\n**25**  \nThe student wants to refute a claim that apricots are a better source of vitamin C than kale is. Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the notes to accomplish this goal?\n\n**A.** Kale contains vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid); in fact, there is 120 mg of vitamin C in every 100 g of kale.  \n**B.** Kale contains ascorbic acid (also known as vitamin C), and apricots do too.  \n**C.** Humans cannot make ascorbic acid in their bodies, but they can get it from kale and apricots.  \n**D.** With 120 mg of vitamin C per every 100 g, kale is actually a better source of vitamin C than apricots, which contain only 10 mg per every 100 g.\n\n--- \n\nFeel free to ask if you need any more assistance!",
