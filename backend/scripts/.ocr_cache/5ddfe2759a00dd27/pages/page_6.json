Here\u2019s the extracted text from the SAT page:\n\n---\n\n**Section 1, Module 1: Reading and Writing**\n\n**Directions**\n\nScientists discovered a 390-million-year-old fossilized forest of *Calamophyton* trees in modern-day England. The scientists believe the emergence of these *Calamophyton* forests changed the land significantly. For example, the tree roots would have greatly reduced soil erosion, and the accumulated twigs the trees shed likely created new habitats for animal life.\n\n**4. Mark for Review**\n\nWhich choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?  \n- A) It suggests that there are likely fossilized *Calamophyton* forests from before 390 million years ago.  \n- B) It provides two competing views of when the *Calamophyton* forest likely merged.  \n- C) It illustrates how *Calamophyton* forests likely changed conditions on the land.  \n- D) It indicates how fast the *Calamophyton* forest spread.  \n\n--- \n\nLet me know if you need anything else!",
