      "explanation": "The correct equation for length in terms of resistance and cross-sectional area is derived from the standard formula R = \u03c1\u2113/A, where \u03c1 is resistivity. Solving for \u2113 gives \u2113 = RA/\u03c1. Comparing with options, C matches \u2113 = (0.43R)/A, assuming \u03c1=0.43.",
