    "explanation": "Add the two equations: $(2x) + (-2x) = (9 + 7y) + (3 + 7y)$ \u2192 $0 = 12 + 14y$ \u2192 $y = -6/7$. Substitute into first equation: $2x = 9 + 7(-6/7)$ \u2192 $2x = 9 - 6$ \u2192 $2x = 3$ \u2192 $x = 1.5$. Then $4x = 6$. Alternatively, subtract the second equation from the first: $(2x) - (-2x) = (9 + 7y) - (3 + 7y)$ \u2192 $4x = 6$ \u2192 $4x = 6$.",
