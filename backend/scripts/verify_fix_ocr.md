*Mark for Review*

The scatterplot shows data set A, which consists of the weights $y$, in pounds, of a Labrador retriever puppy at various ages, $x$, in months. The equation of a line of best fit for the relationship in data set A can be written as $y = -5.1 + 8.7x$, where $2 \leq x \leq 6$.

The puppy was weighed again at 9 months old and weighed 52 pounds. Data set B consists of all the data points in data set A as well as the data point (9, 52). The equation of a line of best fit for data set B can be written as $y = r + sx$, where $r$ and $s$ are constants and $2 \leq x \leq 9$. Assuming the equations of the lines of best fit are calculated in the same way, which of the following is the best estimate for the value of $s$?

A) 5.9  
B) 8.7  
C) 13.8  
D) 17.7
