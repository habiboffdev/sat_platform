The following text is from Louise Erdrich's 1986 novel *The Beet Queen*. The narrator discusses her relationship with her young niece, Dot. Celestine, the narrator's sister-in-law, is Dot's mother.

Dot and I had a mental connection, I was sure of it. I understood things about the baby that her mother could not accept.

For instance, she was never meant to be a baby. Dot was as impatient with babyhood as I. She tried at once to grow out of it. Celestine never saw that, because she, and only she, took pleasure in Dot's helpless softness. Only Celestine was saddened by her daughter's fierce progress. Day by day, Dot grew stronger. In her shopping-cart stroller she exercised to exhaustion, bouncing for hours to develop her leg muscles.

Adelaide is one of many cities that have installed pontoons or other hardening structures to protect their shorelines against coastal hazards. To assess how birds respond to shoreline hardening and other landscape alterations, Diann Prosser et al. used a tool known as the Index of Waterbird Community Integrity to survey bird communities consisting of sixty-four species, including the tundra swan and the great blue heron, in the Chesapeake Bay on the US East Coast. The researchers concluded that shoreline hardening more negatively affects birds than does land development for uses such as housing.

## Section 1, Module 1: Reading and Writing

**Directions**

Researchers who examined data from radio-tagged southern sea otters (*Enhydra lutris nereis*) identified fitness benefits gained by otters that used tools. By using fixed stones as anvils, tool-using otters gained access to high-quality, hard-shelled prey (e.g., mussels and clams) that they could usually not access through biting alone. Non-tool-using otters foraged abundant, energy-poor, easily extractable prey instead (e.g., snails). Even when easily processed prey were depleted, tool-using otters that processed mussels and clams were thus able to obtain their needed energy resources and to do so without incurring tooth damage.

### Question 8

What does the text most strongly suggest about southern sea otters in environments where snails, mussels, and clams are present?

- **A**: Those otters whose diet consists mainly of snails will likely exhibit less tooth damage than will those otters that use tools to consume mussels and clams.
- **B**: Those otters that do not use tools will likely have more robust health than those otters that do use tools.
- **C**: Those otters that do not use tools will likely need to process larger amounts of prey to meet their energy requirements than will those otters that use tools.
- **D**: Those otters that consume mussels and clams without the use of tools will likely spend less time foraging than will those otters that use tools to access the same prey resources.

**Directions**

Over the course of the 1900s, more and more Native Hawaiians spoke English instead of the Hawaiian language. To preserve their language, Native Hawaiian teachers founded the ʻAha Pūnāna Leo preschool in 1984. They spoke Hawaiian while teaching, and their Native Hawaiian students were soon able to understand and speak it themselves. The school was a huge success. Eventually it opened locations around Hawaiʻi and started teaching Hawaiian to elementary and high school students too. Thanks to ʻAha Pūnāna Leo, the number of young people who speak the language has increased.

---

**9**  
Which statement, if true, would most directly support the underlined claim?  

**A.** Besides Native Hawaiians, tens of thousands of people from other Pacific Islander communities live in Hawaiʻi today, including over 37,000 Samoans.  

**B.** Fewer than fifty children could speak Hawaiian when ʻAha Pūnāna Leo was founded, but now more than 2,000 students at ʻAha Pūnāna Leo speak it.  

**C.** Hawaiian is very similar to other languages that are spoken on the Polynesian Islands of the Pacific Ocean, including Tahitian, Samoan, and Māori.  

**D.** Roughly 680,000 Native Hawaiian people lived in the United States in 2020, and a little less than half of them lived in Hawaiʻi.

Carcinization, or the evolution of a crablike body form, has taken place in crustaceans many times over the last 250 million years. Decarcinization has occurred several times as well, even though it involves the loss of traits such as sideways walking that seem to have helped carcinized groups persist in a variety of ecosystems. In a 2021 paper, Joanna Wolfe and team note that many decarcinized groups are extinct and have very few living relatives—signs that decarcinization might be an “evolutionary dead-end.” But the team also discusses frog crabs, a living decarcinized group with traits suited to dwelling in sediment; fossils show that the group had decarcinized members as far back as the Early Cretaceous. This example suggests that _____

## Question 13
Which choice most logically completes the text?

A) the evolutionary benefits of a crablike body form are less certain than many studies of carcinization had previously implied.

B) despite having many living relatives, some decarcinized groups did not benefit from decarcinization.

C) sideways walking may have been less important to the survival of frog crabs than a protected abdomen and other traits associated with carcinization.

D) a crablike body form may not be optimal in all cases, with ecological conditions sometimes favoring the persistence of decarcinization.

Mauricio Drelichman and Hans-Joachim Voth’s research into the debt defaults of Philip II (who ruled an empire including Spain and much of Belgium from 1556 to 1598) relates to other work on European early modern state finance, including Hoffman and Norberg’s research on the relationship between state finance and political development. But Drelichman and Voth’s unique contribution to the field is their reconstruction of the earliest extant set of annual fiscal records for any sovereign state, demonstrating in turn that Philip’s defaults were caused by short-term cash shortages, not long-term unsustainable debts.

A. Analysis of the earliest available records of a sovereign state’s finances can be found not in the work of Hoffman and Norberg but in that of Drelichman and Voth.

B. Drelichman and Voth advanced the field of research on European early modern state finance by assembling a novel collection of evidence that gave them insight into Philip II’s debt defaults.

C. The research by Drelichman and Voth suggests that the logistics of ruling both Spain and much of Belgium led to short-term problems with cash that forced Philip II to default on his debts.

D. Drelichman and Voth’s research on Philip II’s debt defaults builds on earlier work by Hoffman and Norberg, adding nuance to the earlier work’s findings.

In what is now southern Florida, the Calusa people (circa 1000–1600 CE) supported their relatively large population’s dietary needs with hydrological engineering rather than terrestrial farming methods. They constructed watercourts (gated coastal enclosures) out of shells and sediments to trap a variety of fish as waters rose and fell with tides and seasonal sea-level shifts; watercourt pools then held the fish for later consumption. Archaeologist Theresa Schober has posited an additional purpose of these enclosures, suggesting that they were intended to foster conch. She ties this hypothesis to the high value the sea snails would have had for the Calusa, both nutritionally and as a building material (conch shells are highly durable).

---

**11 Mark for Review**

Which finding, if true, would most directly weaken Schober’s hypothesis?

A) Samples of animal remains collected at Calusa sites reflect a greater diversity of marine species, particularly among sea snails, within the perimeter of watercourts than in locations known to have been devoted to the preparation and consumption of food.

B) Historical population-size estimates suggest that the sea snails and fish most common in the Calusa diet were plentiful in open coastal waters when the watercourts were constructed but decreased in abundance in the years immediately after construction.

C) Radar surveys of Calusa sites reveal watercourt dimensions suitable for sustaining fish of many local species but not conducive for maintaining the shallow environments with ample seagrasses that allow sea snails to thrive.

D) Sediment layers excavated from Calusa watercourt sites contain heterogeneous mixtures of scales from multiple species of fish and fragments of shells from various types of sea snails, but conch shells do not constitute the majority of the mixture in most of those layers.

The mating environment hypothesis predicts that populations of flowering plants compensate for reduced mating opportunities due to dichogamy (a plant’s expression of male and female functions at separate times to prevent self-pollination) by adjusting the bias of floral sex allocation during the flowering period, increasing the probability of successful cross-plant pollination. Researchers tested the hypothesis by examining a population of broadleaf arrowhead, a plant for which bloom onset generally takes longer for male flowers than for female flowers, during the flowering season. They concluded that the mating environment hypothesis is not well supported by their observational data.

Which choice best describes data from the table that support the researchers’ conclusion?

A) Whereas the total number of open flowers per growth unit peaked on day 15, the proportion of male flowers experienced a peak earlier in the flowering season, on day 10.

B) Despite the sharp reduction in the total number of open flowers per growth unit from day 15 to 20, there was no decline in the estimated reproductive success rate of male flowers in that interval.

C) Sex allocations were largely evenly distributed on days 10 and 15 but were female biased on days 5 and 20.

D) Although sex allocations became overwhelmingly female biased by day 20, male flowers’ estimated reproductive success rate did not vary from day 5 to 20.

Although Grant Tavirnor concludes that computer games are art by virtue of their forming a subcategory of fiction, and Berys Gaut similarly places them within the realm of cinema, neither approach adequately captures a central aspect of playing these games: when the player no longer attends to the narrative and is instead simply absorbed in the instrumentalities of gameplay. This is among the reasons philosopher C. Thi Nguyen contends that the work of computer-game designers is in what he calls the medium of player agency, which the designer prescribes through rules and goals, and which elicits positive aesthetic experiences in the player who agrees to adopt it. Therefore, Nguyen's position is that Tavirnor’s and Gaut’s frameworks _____

As observed in a 2011 study by Emilio García-Robledo and Alfonso Corzo, macroalgal proliferation may have a suppressive effect on the abundance of cyanobacteria and other microphytobenthos (MPB)—chlorophyll-producing microbes inhabiting marine sediment—in part by reducing the amount of sunlight available to MPB. Examining benthic chlorophyll concentrations (a widely used proxy for MPB biomass) in mudflats in Curlew Bay and other coastal sites in Virginia, Alice F. Besterman and Michael L. Pace found that those concentrations did not negatively correlate with macroalgal proliferation. However, they noted that MPB may respond to low-light conditions by producing higher-than-normal concentrations of chlorophyll, and they thus concluded that _____

## Question 14

Which choice most logically completes the text?

A) researchers ought to account for the possibility that because MPB have the capacity to compensate for reduced sunlight availability, benthic chlorophyll concentrations may not always be a reliable indicator of MPB biomass.

B) although their finding was inconsistent with that of García-Robledo and Corzo, this discrepancy was not attributable to the ability of MPB to accelerate chlorophyll production to mitigate the negative impact of macroalgal accumulations.

C) although elevated levels of macroalgae do not always correspond to increased levels of benthic chlorophyll, there is likely a larger trend in MPB biomass that is related to macroalgal presence but unrelated to light conditions.

D) the effect of macroalgal concentrations on MPB abundance that García-Robledo and Corzo reported was not observed in Curlew Bay and other Virginia sites because low-light conditions likely are not generalizable across the sites in the studies.

The equation of a line of best fit for data set B can be written as $y = r + sx$, where $r$ and $s$ are constants and $2 \leq x \leq 9$. Assuming the equations of the lines of best fit are calculated in the same way, which of the following is the best estimate for the value of $s$?

A) 5.9  
B) 8.7  
C) 13.8  
D) 17.7
